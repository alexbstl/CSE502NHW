% STUDENT: Your text goes here!
\begin{enumerate}
\item (50\%) Using the word processor or editor of your choice, reproduce, as closely as you can, each of the
following quoted blocks of text. Your version must communicate the same information as my original
and must use symbols and math typesetting where appropriate, but of course, it doesnâ€™t have to be
pixel-for-pixel identical (especially the pseudocode).
\begin{enumerate} 
\item "The \textsc{blort-search} algorithm runs in time $\Theta(n^2)$, while the \textsc{Foo-Search} algorithm runs in time $O(n\log n)$ but is faster in practice for only $n > 10000$.  Do not use \textsc{stupid-search}, which is $\Omega(n^5)$."
\item
"It can be shown that for $\epsilon>0$,
\begin{align*}
\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{n\log (n)}{n^{1+\epsilon}}=0
\end{align*}
Moreover,
\begin{align*}
a^{log_b n}=n^{log_b a},
\end{align*}
which is useful for recurrence analysis."
\item "One way to code the \textsc{binary-search} algorithm is as follows:
