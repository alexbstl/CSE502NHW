This problem is an example of \textit{universal hashing},
a strategy for picking hash functions for a hash table randomly so
that no input always exhibits bad hashing behavior.

Let $p$ be a prime number.  I want to hash pairs of numbers $(x,y)$,
where $x$ and $y$ are always between 0 and $p-1$ inclusive.  I
decide to use a chained hash table with hash function
\[
h_{a,b}(x,y) = (ax + by) \bmod p
\]
where $a$ and $b$ also lie between 0 and $p-1$.
